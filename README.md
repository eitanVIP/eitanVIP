# Hi, I'm Eitan 👋

I'm a 16-year-old developer with a passion for coding, robotics, and game development. I started programming at the age of 12 in grade 8, and I've been hooked ever since!

## 🛠️ Skills & Expertise
- **Python**: My go-to language for solving problems, automating tasks, and creating projects.
  
- **Unity**: I love making mobile and desktop games using Unity. Have been doing game development in unity since grade 8.
  
- **FRC Robotics With Java**: I'm the Programming Lead in my team Ninjas #4744 Hadera/Israel.
there I get to combine my love for coding with real-world engineering challenges like image processing for estimating robot's position and complex state machine systems.
  
- **Minecraft**: I also have some experience in developing mods, plugins, datapacks and more in Minecraft! my favorite game.


There are of course many more programming languages and frameworks I know how to work with like ReactJS and C++ but I'm not as good at them.

## 🐰 Meet Mochi
When I'm not coding, you can find me hanging out with my bunny, Mochi. 🐇
And a lot of my games are based on him.

## 📚 Always Learning
I'm constantly exploring new technologies and improving my skills. Whether it's diving deeper into image processing, electronic programming and ReactJS, I'm always up for a challenge.
