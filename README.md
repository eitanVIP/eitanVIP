# Hi, I'm Eitan 👋

I'm a 16-year-old developer with a passion for programming, robotics, game development and cyber. I started programming at the age of 12 in grade 8, and I've been hooked ever since!

## 🛠️ Skills & Expertise
- **Python**: My go-to language for solving problems, automating tasks, and creating projects.
  
- **Unity**: I love making mobile and desktop games using Unity. Have been doing game development in unity since grade 8.
  
- **FRC Robotics With Java**: I'm the Programming Lead in my team Ninjas #4744 Hadera/Israel.
there I get to combine my love for coding with real-world engineering challenges like image processing for estimating robot's position and complex state machine systems.
  
- **Minecraft**: I also have some experience in developing mods, plugins, datapacks and more in Minecraft! my favorite game.
  
- **Cyber**: In addition, I'm currently learining and improving my cyber security skills by PicoCTF and my own C++ from scratch tcp project, RemoteLink.

There are of course many more programming languages and frameworks I know how to work with like ReactJS but I'm not as good at them.

## 🐰 Meet Mochi
When I'm not coding, you can find me hanging out with my bunny, Mochi. 🐇
And a lot of my games are based on him.

## 📚 Always Learning
I'm constantly exploring new technologies and improving my skills. Whether it's diving deeper into computer vision processing, electronic and robotic programming, ReactJS and web, and cyber. I'm always up for a challenge.
